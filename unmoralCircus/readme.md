*THE UNMORAL CIRCUS*
*WHERE YOU'LL HAVE FUN FAILING AND FAILING AGAIN*


Multiple games are held here,

First you have to enter the circus by pressing the "enter the realm of jokes", once clicked you'll be in the main screen.
In that screen you'll have to choose between:

	- Strength Test
	- Moral Test
	- Dexerity Test
Strength Test:
Try to find the trick to this rigged fair attraction! Click in the middle black button to measure your strength.

Moral Test:
Try not to laugh to the jokes, I am not responsible for the offensive content, you have been warned.

Dexerity Test:
Try to shoot all the images! You may end up giving up...


JavaScript and jQuery notes:

I am currently working in the dexerity test since the code can be better.
